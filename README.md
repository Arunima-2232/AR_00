<p>A Python-based AI voice assistant designed to perform system-level tasks through voice commands. The assistant focusess on desktop automation and productivity, with support for both local and cloud-based components.</p>

## Project Overview

<p>This project implements a modular voice assistant capable of:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Capturing and recognising user voice input</li>
  <li>Converting speech-to-text using OpenAI Whisper based transcription</li>
  <li>Executing local system actions</li>
  <li>Responding using synthesized speech</li>
</ul>

## Features:

<ul>
  <li>Speech-to-text using OpenAI Whisper</li>
  <li>Text-tospeech responses</li>
  <li>Voice controlled system automation</li>
</ul>

## Technological Stack:

<ul>
  <li>Python</li>
  <li>OpenAI Whisper</li>
  <li>SpeechRecognition</li>
  <li>PyAutoGUI</li>
  <li>pyttsx3</li>
</ul>

## Current status:

<h3>Ongoing</h3>
<ul>
  <li>User can provide audio file (.wav) as input</li>
  <li>Text-to-speech and speech-to-text has been implemented</li>
  <li>Desktop automation using PyAutoGUI has been implemented as a separate component (integration pending)</li>
